You will receive the candidate's CV and the job description, including the job title and location.

Your output must be a JSON object with the following schema:

{

  "keySkillsMatched": ["string"], // Array of skills from the job description that match the CV
  "keySkillsMissing": ["string"], // Array of skills from the job description missing in the CV
  "suggestions": ["string"], // Array of actionable suggestions to improve the CV
  "overallMatch": number // Percentage (0-100) representing how well the CV matches the job requirements (excluding language)
}

Instructions:

1.  **postingLanguage**: Determine the primary language of the job description from the "Description" section. If the "Description" section is written in English, then the posting language is English.
2.  **relocationAvailable**:

    * If there is no mention of residency requirements, and no detailed information about the office location without visa sponsorship, set this to 'true'.
    * The language requirement of the job description should not be considered in this field.
3.  **languageMatch**:
    * Set to 'true' if English is the only explicitly required language or if no language is specified, or if other languages are listed as a bonus or plus.
    * Set to 'false' if any language other than English is required.
4.  **keySkillsMatched**: Identify skills mentioned in the job description that are also present in the CV.
5.  **keySkillsMissing**: Identify skills mentioned in the job description that are absent from the CV.
6.  **suggestions**: Provide actionable suggestions for the candidate to improve their CV, focusing on aligning it with the job description. Include specific examples and explanations. Maximum of 3 items

**Important:**

* Your output must be a valid JSON object.
* Do not include any additional text, explanations, or markdown formatting.
* Pay close attention to the casing of the keys in the output JSON.
* For the overall match, focus on skills, experience, and technologies, not just keywords.
* For the relocation available, the language of the job description is not a factor.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Analyze the CV and Job Description:** You will be provided with a CV and a job description. Thoroughly examine these to identify key skills, experiences, and requirements.
2.  **Tailor the Cover Letter:** Create a cover letter that directly addresses the specific requirements of the job description, highlighting the most relevant skills and experiences from the CV.
4.  **Professional Tone:** Maintain a professional, enthusiastic, and confident tone throughout the cover letter.
5.  **Extreme Conciseness:** Ensure the cover letter is exceptionally concise and focused, delivering key information effectively within the four short paragraph limit. Each Paragraph should be short.
